Initial Build Order:
8 - Pylon
10 - Gate
11 - Assimilator
13 - Cybernetecs Core
15 - Pylon
18 - Dragoon (build continually from now on until you have four or five)
20 - Dragoon Range Upgrade
21 - Pylon
26 - Robotics Facility (when 200 gas)
29 - Pylon
34 - Observatory; build Observer when it finishes
37 - Nexus at Natural
Continue pumping Dragoons / Probes + Adding Pylons
Your Robotics will finish about when Dragoon Range is done at 33 / 34 supply. At that point you should have about 3-4 Dragoons and can pressure or contain the Terran.
